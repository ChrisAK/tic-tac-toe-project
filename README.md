# Tic-Tac-Toe!
### By: Chris Kennelly

## Welcome to my Project!

This Tic-Tac-Toe game showcases the skills I have gained through the first few weeks of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program.

By building a custom game engine and front end I have made a game that allows people to play 1 vs 1 local tic-tac-toe as well as login so they can keep track of their games.

## Tech

JavaScript: Used to build the engine through the use of constructors and prototypes
HTML: Used to build the frame of the game as well as forms for sign-in and sign-out.
CSS: Used to make the game look good as well as control the animated nav bar.
jQuery: Used to create click handlers as well as control the html for error and win messages.
Ajax: Used to make calls to the API for sign-in, sign-up, sign-out, changing passwords, as well as creating and recieveing information about saved games.

User Stories:
- I want to play tic tac toe.
- I want to be able to log in and out.
- I want to be able to play against another person.
- I want to choose if I am X or O.
- I want to save my game.

## Future Plans

In the future I would like to address a couple concerns. On smaller screens the nav bar can sometimes cover up the header and image. I would also like to make the CSS cleaner and better looking. Adding multiplayer, especially across the internet would also, I feel, add some much needed functionality to the game.
